# Prisoner's Dilemma Game

## Overview

The **Prisoner's Dilemma Game** is a strategic game built with Go, allowing players to explore the classic game theory problem. Players can compete against each other either locally or over a network, choosing between cooperation or defection in each round. The outcome of each decision impacts their "prison time," with the goal of minimizing their own time.

## Features

- **Local and Network Play**: Choose to play against another player on the same machine or over the network.
- **Multiple Rounds**: Customize the number of rounds and view summaries after the game.
- **AI Opponent**: Play against different AI strategies like Tit-for-Tat or Random (future release).
- **Futuristic UI**: Experience a sleek, animated interface with cool ASCII art and a modern design (future release).
